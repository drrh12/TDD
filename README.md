# TDD

# First Lab

For the first and second lab you will need to have npm installed.
https://www.npmjs.com/

First download the filee below:
https://github.com/drrh12/TDD/tree/main/Jest-First-Lab
https://github.com/drrh12/TDD/tree/main/Jest-Second-Lab

Run "npm install" to add the node_modules.
Install Jest framework running "npm install --save-dev jest"

We are going to add only for development mode. Make sure that the script "test" inside the package.json file is changed to "test" : "jest".

After it, you will need to navigate in the console and typ "npm test". Jest will execute the tests, and if you want to better visualize the coverage, open the .html generated inside the coverage folder.
